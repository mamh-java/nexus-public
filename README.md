## Build Requirements

Builds use Apache Maven and require Java 17. Apache Maven wrapper scripts are included in the source tree.

## Building From Source

Released versions are tagged and branched using a name of the form `release-{version}`. For example: `release-3.78.0-04`

To build a tagged release, first fetch all tags:

```shell
git fetch --tags
```

Then checkout the remote branch you want. For example:

```shell
git checkout -b release-3.78.0-04 origin/release-3.78.0-04 --
```

Then build using the included Maven wrapper script. For example:

```shell
./mvnw clean install
```

## Running

To run Nexus Repository Core after building:

1. Navigate to `assemblies/nexus-repository-core/target/assembly`
2. Run `java -jar bin/nexus-repository-core-*.jar`

The application will create a sonatype-work directory at `assemblies/nexus-repository-core/target/sonatype-work`, 
which will contain the default administrator credentials, database, and file blobstore.
